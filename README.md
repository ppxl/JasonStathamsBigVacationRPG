# JASON STATHAM'S BIG VACATION RPG

Jason Statham, international movie star, is on his holidays. But: his own impulsive nature, and the attentions of his
rival the Wesley Sniper, could ruin everything! It's up to you, a skilled team of operatives paid for by his management,
to ensure that he has a great time.

## GAME RULES

When you attempt an action and the Statham Master reckons the outcome is in doubt, roll a D12. If it shows 4 or less,
the action goes well for you (on a 1, it goes very well). If it shows more, the action goes badly. (On a 12, it goes
very badly.) If you have a skill that relates to the action in question, roll equal to or under the skill rating
instead of 4.
Every time you roll a D12, roll a D6 as well. This is the Statham Dice. If the Statham Dice shows the same number as
the D12, Jason has dones something unpredictable!

### THE WESLEY SNIPER

Wesley Snipes hounds popular action stars in a quest for deranged vengeance. He has sworn never to shoot other actors
with his high-calibre rifle, but everything else is fair game. He will interfere with every scene from afar - he's too
distant to be stopped, and so the team must work around him.

### ADRENALINE

If an action goes badly and it was dangerous, the SM may rule that the character is injured or stressed and shifts a
point from STABILITY into ADRENALINE. Whenever you roll a D12, add your ADRENALINE total to the roll. If your STABILITY
hits 0, you die or go mad or are otherwise rendered unable to help Jason enjoy his holiday.

### SCENES

There are 4 scenes in each game. SM, roll to see what's on the itinerary for today - and also what the Wesley Sniper
does to mess things up, but keep this bit secret until it comes into play. On the last scene, roll twice on both tables
and combine the results.

Before a scene starts, pick a Statham Track that will come under threat during this scene. The players pick one, too,
and then play begins.
Every scene begins in a smash-cut non-sequitur as Jason wakes up, kicks in a door and enters, or both. A scene ends
when SM feels it's over.

## THE STATHAM TRACKS

When the SM believes that Jason has become closer to death, boredom, arrest or sadness, mark D3 points on the relevant
track. (The players should always get a chance to stop him) If the result on the D3 would fill the track in question,
Statham enters DANGER MODE. Immediately switch to the relevant scene, outlined below - the players have one chance to
avert disaster, and save his holiday, else they'll all be fired.
Players can reduce the Statham tracks with appropriate successful actions - 1 for a small action, 2 for a medium action,
and 3 for a serious repair job.

Condition| Statham Tracks | Result
-------- | --------------- | -------
DEAD     | [][][][][][][][]| Jason Statham is dying
SAD      | [][][][][][][][]| Jason Statham breaks down in tears in the street, leading to a PR disaster
ARRESTED | [][][][][][][][]| Jason Statham is jailed and must be liberated
BORED    | [][][][][][][][]| Jason Statham calls his mum (played by Helen Mirren) to come and pick him up
